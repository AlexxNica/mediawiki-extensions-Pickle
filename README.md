# Spec

This extension adds basic spec-style testing to Lua modules.

## Feature

To make it possible to do efficient testing it will detect some pages as holding a Spec, and the Lua code on
those pages can be run both automatic and manual.

## State

This is an on-going project at [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Spec),
and as such will be extremly unstable &ndash; it might even trigger a meltdown of your computer. :)
